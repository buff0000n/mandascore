    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <p>
        This is an app for viewing and editing Mandachord songs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main motivation was to provide a way to be able to copy my songs into the game without having to
        pause a video.  But while I was at it I went ahead and made it a full blown editor.
    </p>
    <h2>Mandachord song codes?</h2>
    <p>
        There actually is a Mandachord song code format.  If you link a song in chat, and then look at your
        EE.log file after quitting Warframe, then you will see something like this:
    </p>
    <code>
        [SONG-Best Song Ever:AADDnwAAEggAAIggAEGBAJCAAABIAAAYAAgFwAECkCAgiAAAKEEACYAhAoAAAAgAAQgICCHAgQCQAEEIAABIQgAJgCEEgAAASAAIGAAABYAAIYAIIQgAAEgCBEGAABCAAAAIAAEIAAhBwgEAkA==:BardCorpusPackA:BardGrineerPackA:BardCorpusPackB]
    </code>
    <p>
        You used to be able to paste this back into the in-game chat window and get a song link back, but
        unfortunately that hasn't worked in a couple of years.  Still, it's as good a format as any, so that's
        what this editor is using.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a program for extracting song codes from your EE.log file, if you're comfortable with
        running python: <a href="https://github.com/buff0000n/songparse">songparse</a>.

    <h1 id="tocGettingStarted">Getting Started</h1>
    <p>
        If you came here from a song link then it should already be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have a song code then paste it in the <strong>Song Code</strong> text box and hit enter.
    </p>

    <h1 id="tocEditing">Basic Editing</h1>
    <p>
        If you're familiar with the in-game Mandachord editor then you already know how most of this works.
    </p>
    <h2 id="tocTitle">Title</h2>
    <p>
        Enter the title of the song here.  The in-game restrictions on Mandachord song titles are pretty
        severe, but the only thing being restricted here is a 24 character limit
    </p>
    <h2 id="tocInstruments">Instruments</h2>
    <p>
        You can adjust the settings here for each section individually: Percussion, Bass, and Melody.
    </p>
    <h3 id="tocInstrumentpack">Instrument Pack</h3>
    <p>
        Use the dropdown to choose one of the nine instrument packs.
    </p>
    <h3 id="tocVolume">Volume</h3>
    <p>
        Use the slider to adjust the volume.  Full volume is all the way to thr right, zero volume is all the
        way to the left.
    </p>
    <h3 id="tocIsolation">Isolation</h3>
    <p>
        Use the checkboxes on the right to turn particular sections on and off.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the isolation settings are not part of the song code and don't get saved.
    </p>
    <h2 id="tocNotes">Notes</h2>
    <p>
        The rest of the screen is dedicated to the note grid.  This is laid out just like the Mandachord
        screen, except as a rectangle instead of a disc.
    <p>
        The top three rows are percussion, the next five are bass, and the bottom five are melody.  Time
        ordering goes from left to right.
    </p>
    <p>
        Click a location in the grid to turn a note on, or click a location with an existing note to turn that
        note off.  You can also click and drag across an area to create multiple notes next to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        The score is broken out into four measures.  Each measure has a maximum number of notes that can be
        present in each section:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Percussion</strong>: 26 notes per measure</li>
        <li><strong>Bass</strong>: 16 notes per measure</li>
        <li><strong>Melody</strong>: 16 notes per measure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong class="warn">Exceeding the note limit on a section of a measure will play a small warning sound.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If your screen is wide enough then all four measures will be displayed in a single row.
        If your screen is not wide enough for that, then there will be two rows of two.
        If your screen is not wide enough for that the four measures will be arranged vertically.
    </p>
    <h1 id="tocAdvancedEditing">Advanced Editing</h1>
    <h2 id="tocClear">Clear</h2>
    <h3 id="tocClearMeasure">Clear Measure</h3>
    <p>
        Above each measure is a
        <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-clear.png" srcset="img2x/icon-clear.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Clear</strong> button.  This can be used to clear part or all of the
        measure.  Clicking this will bring up a menu:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>All</strong>: Use this to completely clear the measure</li>
        <li><strong>Percussion</strong>: Use this to clear just the Percussion section of the measure</li>
        <li><strong>Bass</strong>: Use this to clear just the Bass section of the measure</li>
        <li><strong>Melody</strong>: Use this to clear just the Melody section of the measure</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="tocClearSong">Clear Song</h3>
    <p>
        Above the <strong>Song Title</strong> bar is another
        <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-clear.png" srcset="img2x/icon-clear.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Clear</strong> button.  This allows you to clear notes from all four measures.  It has the same
        options as the per-measure <strong>Clear</strong> button: <strong>All</strong>,
        <strong>Percussion</strong>, <strong>Bass</strong>, or <strong>Melody</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="tocCopyPaste">Copy/Paste</h2>
    <h3 id="tocCopyPasteMeasure">Copy/Paste Measure</h3>
    <p>
        Above each measure is a
        <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-copy.png" srcset="img2x/icon-copy.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Copy</strong> button.  This can be used to copy part or all of the
        measure, allowing it to be pasted to a different measure.  Clicking this button
        will bring up the usual section options: <strong>All</strong>, <strong>Percussion</strong>,
        <strong>Bass</strong>, or <strong>Melody</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once a copy selection is made in one measure, the
        <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-paste.png" srcset="img2x/icon-paste.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Paste</strong>
        buttons are enabled on the
        other three measures.  Clicking the <strong>Paste</strong> button will copy the selected section from
        the copied measure into that measure, overwriting any existing notes in that section.
    </p>
    <h3 id="tocCopyPasteSong">Copy/Paste song</h3>
    <p>
        Above the <strong>Song Title</strong> bar is another set of
        <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-copy.png" srcset="img2x/icon-copy.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Copy</strong> and
        <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-paste.png" srcset="img2x/icon-paste.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Paste</strong> buttons.  This allows you to copy and paste notes from all four measures.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is mainly useful when editing a playlist.  It allows you to copy all or part of a song into
        another playlist entry.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong class="warn">Only one thing can be copied at a time, either part of a measure or part of the
            whole song</strong>
    </p>
    <h3 id="tocPasteSwap">Copy/Paste between Melody and Bass </h3>
    <p>
        If just a melody or a bass section has been copied, then holding the <strong>Shift</strong> key
        down while clicking the
        <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-paste.png" srcset="img2x/icon-paste.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Paste</strong> button will bring up another section menu, containing just
        <strong>Bass</strong> or <strong>Melody</strong>.  Select the section to paste into.
    </p>
    <p>
        This allows you to copy a melody to a bass, or vice-verse.  This works with both a single measure and
        the whole song.
    </p>
    <h3 id="tocCopyPastePerformance">Copy/Paste Performance</h3>
    <p>
        Click the song-level
        <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-copy.png" srcset="img2x/icon-copy.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Copy</strong> button and choose
        <img class="docButton" src="img/perf.png" srcset="img2x/perf.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Performance</strong> to copy the instrument pack and volume settings for the current song.
        Clicking <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-paste.png" srcset="img2x/icon-paste.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Paste</strong> on another song in the playlist will paste those settings into that song.
    </p>

    <h1 id="tocUndoRedo">Undo/Redo</h1>
    <p>
        Undo and Redo is available using either the
        <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-undo.png" srcset="img2x/icon-undo.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Undo</strong> and
        <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-redo.png" srcset="img2x/icon-redo.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Redo</strong> buttons
        above the <strong>Song Title</strong> bar, or by using <strong>Ctrl-Z</strong> for undo and
        <strong>Ctrl-Shift-Z</strong> or <strong>Ctrl-Y</strong> for redo.
    </p>
    <p>
        All actions can be undone, including note changes, section setting changes, title changes, paste,
        clear, loading a song from the library, and all edits made to the playlist.
    </p>
    <h1 id="tocPlayback">Playback</h1>
    <p>
        Use the
        <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-play.png" srcset="img2x/icon-play.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Play</strong>
        buttons to start and stop playback on either all or part of the song.
        Playback will loop back to the beginning until stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just like in game, the current playback location is marked with a vertical line, and individual notes
        will have a small visual bounce as they are played.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pressing <strong>Space</strong> during playback will pause at its current location.  Pressing
        <strong>Space</strong> again will resume playback where it left off.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pressing <strong>Shift-Space</strong> or holding <strong>Shift</strong> and clicking
        <strong>Play</strong> during playback or while playback is paused will restart playback at the
        beginning of the song or measure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pressing the same
        <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-stop.png" srcset="img2x/icon-stop.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Stop</strong> button while playing will stop playback and clear the current
        playback location.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong class="warn">Note: The sounds themselves were recorded in-game.  I hope this is okay.</strong>

    </p>
    <p>
        Clicking the

    <h2 id="tocPlayCursor">Play Cursor</h2>
    <p>
        Click on the ruler bar above the note section to move the playback cursor to that location.  This
        works even when playback is in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
        Click on the ruler bar or the cursor itself and drag to move the playback cursor across the song
        while playing any notes under the cursor.  It's both fun and pointless.
    </p>
    <h1 id="tocSaving">Saving</h1>
    <p>
        There are three ways to save your song for later: by code, by URL, or by generating an image.
    </p>
    <h2 id="tocSongCode">Song Code</h2>
    <p>
        To save your song by code, simply copy the code out of the <strong>Song Code</strong> bar at the top
        of the page.  This Song Code is automatically updated as changes are made to the song.
    </p>
    <p>
        To restore a song from a code, open this page again and paste the song code into the
        <strong>Song Code</strong> bar.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong class="warn">Unfortunately, that's all you can currently do with a song code.</strong>  You used
        to be able to paste the song code into the in-game chat window and get a song link back, but that
        hasn't worked in years.
    </p>
    <h2 id="tocShareURL">Share URL</h2>
    <p>
        If you want a shareable URL that goes directly to your song, click the
        <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-link.png" srcset="img2x/icon-link.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Link</strong>
        button at the top of the page.  Copy this, and paste it into a browser to bring up this page
        auto-populated with your song.
    </p>
    <h2 id="tocExportToPng">Export to PNG</h2>
    <p>
        If you want an image, then click the
        <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-png.png" srcset="img2x/icon-png.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Generate PNG</strong> button at the top of the page.
        This will bring up a link to download your song as a PNG, including section settings and all four
        measures.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note that you cannot re-import a PNG to edit it again.</strong>  You should also save your
        song as either a Song Code or URL so you can come back to it later.
    </p>
    <h2 id="tocExportToWav">Export to WAV</h2>
    <p>
        If you want an audio file, then click the
        <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-wav.png" srcset="img2x/icon-wav.png 2x"/>
        <strong>Generate WAV</strong> button at the top of the page.
        This will export the song loop, or the entire playlist if you have one open, to an uncompressed
        WAV file.
    </p>
    <p>
        While the WAV file is rendering, clicking anywhere outside the progress box will close it and cancel
        the process.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong class="warn">Note that this can take a long time.</strong>  You will be able to watch the progress as it
        renders the WAV file.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong class="warn">Note that this does not work in all browsers.</strong>  Nothing I can really do
        about it.  There is full support in Chrome and Edge, partial support in Firefox, and no support in Safari.
    </p>
    <h2 id="tocAutosaveSong">Autosave</h2>
    <p>
        As you are editing, your song will automatically be saved to your browser's location bar.  If you use
        the browser's forward/back buttons, intentionally or accidentally, then reversing that back to this
        page should resume where you left off.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong class="warn">Note: Updates take a second or two to appear in the location bar.</strong>
    </p>

    <h1 id="tocLibrary">Library</h1>
    <p>
        Click the <strong>Library</strong> button to enable the library.  This contains a demo for each
        instrument pack, along with every Mandachord request I've done.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong class="warn">There are thousands of songs and it's all loaded into your browser.  I'm
            not sure how well this works on devices with limited memory.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2 id="tocLibraryNavigating">Navigating the Library</h2>
    <p>
        The library is loosely categorized by genre and artist.  Click on a category header to expand that category.
        Click it again to collapse it back down.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Next to each category is a count of the total number of songs it contains.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some categories contain sub-categories, and some just contain songs.  Below the main categories,
        subcategories are roughly ordered by artist, and individual songs are ordered by title.
    </p>
    <p>
        Click the
        <img class="docButton" src="img/icon-burger.png" srcset="img2x/icon-burger.png 2x"/>

    <h2 id="tocLoadingASong">Loading a song</h2>
    <p>
        Click on a song entry to load it into the Mandascore editor.  If the editor is currently playing
        then playback will be reset to the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the selected song has more than one Mandachord loop then the <strong>Playlist</strong> will be
        temporarily enabled, and playback will go through all the loops.
    </p>
    <h3 id="tocBuildingAPlaylist">Building a playist</h3>
    <p>
        By default, clicking a song in the library will replace the song currently in the Mandacore.  If the
        previously selected library song had multiple Mandachord loops then the playlist will be cleared for
        the new song.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enable the playlist by clicking the <strong>Playlist</strong> button, making sure it's lit up.
        This will keep the playlist up and append songs as they are selected.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tocSearchingTheLibrary">Searching the library</h2>
    <p>
        By default, the entire library is listed.  Songs are categorized by my completely arbitrary
        classification system.
    </p>

    <h3 id="tocKeywordSearch">Keyword Search</h3>
    <p>
        The bar at the top is a search bar.  Enter one or more keywords to narrow down the listing.  The keyword
        can be a category, a title, an artist, or anything else that appears in the description of the song.
    </p>
    <p>
        Multiple keywords can be entered.  Only songs that match all the keywords will be shown.

    <h1 id="tocInstrumentpackNotes">Instrument Pack Notes</h1>
    <h2 id="tocAdau">Adau</h2>
    <p>
        The default instrument is ironically one of the hardest to work with.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>percussion</strong> is different from all the other instrument packs.  It's a low drum, a
        double-drum, and a high drum.  The double-drum is unique: a single note actually plays twice, a
        sixteenth note apart.  Putting a series of middle-drum notes one grid square apart will play a
        continuous drum roll.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've found the best way to work with Adau percussion is to use the high and low drums as the basis
        of the rhythm, and the middle double-drum supporting the other two as a lead-in or filler.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>bass</strong> is the only bass in the current instrument pack lineup that's pitched high and
        clear enough to do chords.  That's usually how I use it.  Unfortunately, because it's pitched so high,
        and because I'm usually doubling up with chords, it tends to drown out most melodies.  For that reason
        I usually back the volume off a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>melody</strong> is very, very mushy.  Single notes are very hard to distinguish a clear
        start time.  Fast notes just blend together.
    </p>
    <p>
        The one place where the Adau melody shines is emulating long-held notes.  Because of the mushiness,
        repeating a note every grid space will blend together into a single, long note.  Adau is the only
        melody that can do this well.  You can also quickly alternate between 2-3 notes and get a similar
        effect as a long-held chord.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tocAlpha">Alpha</h2>
    <p>
        The Alpha instrument pack is 100% Techno.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>percussion</strong> has a very distinctive 80's techno bass drum, but it should be used
        sparingly unless you're going for an obnoxious "hard-bass" style.  The snare is a relatively
        high-pitched whip-crack snare, also best used sparingly.  The hi-hat is one of the strongest in the
        line-up, but not overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've found the best way to use the Alpha percussion is to keep it simple with the bass and snare, and
        save the creativity for the hi-hat.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>bass</strong> notes take about half a measure to play out and aren't very strong.  This is
        more of a atmospheric bass than something you can make a recognizable bass line out of.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>melody</strong> is one of the best overall melodies in the line-up.  Each note takes about
        2-3 grid spaces to play out, so it's not great for fast melodies.  Otherwise it's very strong and
        clear.  I use it a lot for mid-range, slower melodies that I want to be recognizable.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tocBeta">Beta</h2>
    <p>
        Beta is one of the more low-key instrument packs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>percussion</strong> bass and hi-hat are relatively gentle.  I tend to use them if the song
        I'm trying to adapt doesn't have percussion at all.  The snare, on the other hand, is pretty aggressive.
        In some of my longer videos I use the Beta snare in place of a crash cymbal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>bass</strong> is very low, almost sub-audible.  You feel it more than you hear it.  You can
        do a pretty chill bass line with it, but people aren't really going to be able to recognize it as
        anything.  It's also pretty good at doing a long-held bass note if you repeat it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>melody</strong> kind of suffers from the out-of-tune sound, but it's pretty short not
        counting the echo.  It's a decent choice for fast melodies, and the echo can fill in slower ones.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is my default substitute melody for Piano.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tocBombast">Bombast</h2>
    <p>
        This instrument pack comes with Octavia Prime.  This might be a problem after Octavia Prime is vaulted,
        but for now I plan on using it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>percussion</strong> might replace Gamma as my go-to Hip Hop percussion.  A strong bump
        bass, a sharp clap for a snare, and a clear hi-hat.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>bass</strong> is excellent.  It's low like <strong>Beta</strong>, but shorter and stronger.
        It blends together very nicely when played fast.  I can do a lot with this bass.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>melody</strong> is unlike anything else in the Mandachord lineop.  It's your classic West
        Coast hip hop lead.  There are built-in bends that make it awkward, especially on the lower two.  It's
        pretty niche, but it's good for making anything sound like it's backing Snoop Dogg.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both the melody and the bass are monophonic.  They literally won't do chords; if you put multiple notes
        at the same time then only the highest one will play.  This is very noticeable with the melody, it
        would be a mess without it, but the bass does this as well.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tocDelta">Delta</h2>
    <p>
        Delta is kind of an oddball.  I use its percussion a lot, but I almost never touch its bass or melody.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>percussion</strong> has a strong, short snare that I use a lot for drum and bass and a
        couple of EDM styles.  The bass and hi-hat fit well but aren't anything special, I mostly use this
        for the snare.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>bass</strong> is both very disinctive and hard to deal with.  The main sound is delayed
        enough that you have to place it a grid square ahead of when you want it to actually play.  When it
        plays its sound cuts through everything, you usually have to knock the volume back to hear anything
        else.
    </p>
    <p>
        I just never end up using this bass.  You need a really good sound match before it makes sense over any
        of the other bass options.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like the <strong>Bombast</strong> bass, the <strong>Delta</strong> bass is monophonic, but it's hard
        to tell sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>melody</strong>.  Personally, I've never heard the Delta melody used in-game in any way
        <i>other</i> than to be as obnoxious as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like the <strong>Bombast</strong> melody, the <strong>Delta</strong> melody is monophonic.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is possible to make something interesting and okay to listen to.  But you have to spend a lot of
        time playing with the five notes and seeing how they can blend together.  They all sound very different,
        and bear only a passing resemblance to the scale note they represent.  The bottom four take almost
        half a measure to play out, but the top note is faster can get away with being played quicker.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tocDruk">Druk</h2>
    <p>
        Druk is heavy metal all the way
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>percussion</strong> is very strong and loud.  Since you can't vary the volume it comes
        off a little too strong if you really hammer on it like a heavy metal drummer, but it's not usually
        a problem.  For any music with a live drummer it's usually either Druk or Plogg, depending on
        how heavy it is.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>bass</strong> is my favorite bass in the line-up.  It's clear and short.  You can build
        a huge variety of complicated bass lines.  It cuts through battle noise very well in game.  Sometimes
        if you've got a very busy bass against a weaker melody you'll want to cut the volume a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is easily my most used bass.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>melody</strong> is kind of mushy, and also an octave below most of the other melodies in
        the line-up.  If I try and do a busy melody line with this then I'll always double it up on the bass
        to give it more definition.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a pretty hard time hearing the Druk melody when I'm in mission, so I usually keep it simple.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tocEpsilon">Epsilon</h2>
    <p>
        Epsilon is EDM with a more Eurobeat-feel to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>percussion</strong> has among the longest snare and hi-hat sounds, good for filling a
        lot of space or cutting through other sounds.  The bass drum is low and long as well, but my reasons
        for using Epsilon percussion are mostly for the snare and hi-hat.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>bass</strong> is hard to work with because it's a dual sound.  First a low note, then one
        grid square later a higher, clearer note.  I find this works best when you place it a grid square
        before where you want it to sound.  The higher part also tends to overshadow some melodies, making it
        even tougher to use effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>bass</strong> is <i>kind of</i> monophonic, within each tone.  If you play two instances
        of the same tone quickly one right after another then the first one will stop playing when the second
        one starts.  However, you can play two different bass tones simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>melody</strong> is an octave or more above all the other melodies in the line-up.  It takes
        a whole quarter note to fully play out, but it doesn't get mushy with faster melodies.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is my go-to choice for high-pithed melodies, including high strings.
    <p>
    </p>

    <h2 id="tocGamma">Gamma</h2>
    <p>
        Gamma is mainly for hip-hop, but the melody is extremely versatile.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>percussion</strong> is my go-to for any rap or hip-hip.  It has a very strong hi-hat, and
        a high pitched snare that's almost like a hand-clap.  The bass drum is pretty standard but fits
        with the theme.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>bass</strong> is a low brass note that takes about a quarter-note to play out.  You can't
        do fast bass-lines, but you can fill space with it.  Most of the time, if I'm doing hip-hop then I end
        up doubling up the base on the bass drum rhythm.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>melody</strong> is my go-to melody for anything fast-paced.  Aside from a little but of
        de-tuning, it's short and clear and great for just about anything with a lot of sixteenth notes.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's a toss-up whether Gamma or Alpha is my most used melody.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tocHoros">Horos</h2>
    <p>
        Horos is the community-voted "EDM" pack which... I mean, half the instrument packs in the
        line-up qualify as "EDM".  The community is dumb sometimes, but it's a good instrument pack.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>percussion</strong> bass drum and snare make a solid club beat.  I find myself just doing
        bass drum on the beast and snare every other beat a lot with this instrument pack.  The only unfortunate
        thing is the hi-hat, which is so weak it's almost inaudible compared to the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>bass</strong> is my second-favorite bass after druk.  It's short and clear, and you can
        do tons of stuff with it.  I find myself using it a lot for repetitive synth-wave bass lines.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>melody</strong> is pretty hard to use.  Each note has is a built-in chord, a ton of
        overtones, and echoes for a good 3/4 of a measure.  The best way to use this is sparingly.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tocPlogg">Plogg</h2>
    <p>
        Plogg is kind of a lighter rock, except the bass player keeps his amp turned up way too loud even
        though they keep asking him to dial it back.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>percussion</strong> is a pretty standard live drum kit.  Its strength is that it's so
        generic that it fits in everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>bass</strong> is the loudest in the line-up.  Honestly, when I use this bass I usually
        turn it down to half-volume.  It takes two grid squares to sound out, so it's not for fast bass lines.
    </p>
    <p>
        The one exception is if I need a long-held bass note that's as hardcore loud as possible.  Repeating a
        Plogg bass note like with the Adau melody works pretty good for that.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>melody</strong>, like Druk, is an octave below most of the other melodies.  I use this
        a lot for low male vocals, and the occasional clean guitar.  It takes two grid squares to sound out
        so it's not great for fast melodies.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tocClazzConcept">Clazz (Concept)</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3ZruCCdfKI">Original video</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        The instrument pack request I hear the most is "piano".  So here's my concept.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>percussion</strong> is smooth jazz, because even Plogg is still too heavy for some songs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>bass</strong> is high and clear enough to play chords.  The only other bass that can do that right now is
        Adau.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>melody</strong> is an octave higher than most of the other melodies.  We don't have enough of those and most
        piano requests I get fall into that range.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tocZetaConcept">Zeta (Concept)</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6VN7DbkIhg">Original video</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        I would love a reto-gaming chiptune instrument pack.  So here's my concept.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>percussion</strong> is based on a Commodore 64, the earliest thing I could think of that
        can pull off a distinct bass drum.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>bass</strong> is from some Super Breakout clone I used to play.  I can't remember the
        platform but I can hear that ball bouncing sound very clearly in my head.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wanted something high and chill for the <strong>melody</strong>, because we don't really have
        anything like that yet.  I guess it turned out a little Nintendo-esque?

            The library data store and search function is pretty dumb right now.  It possibly doesn't work so
            great on devices with limited horsepower.

            There may be some delay when playing an instrument pack for the first time.  This is because of
            the safeguards a lot of browsers have in place to prevent auto-play video and audio.  There isn't
            much I can do about it.  You have to click something before it can even load the sounds.

            The playback note animations sometimes cause Firefox to continually reload the note images
            over and over again.

            With Safari and possibly iOS, minimizing or otherwise hiding the window while it's playing will
            stop the audio.  When you come back it takes a few tries playing and stopping before it fully
            returns.  I'm not quite sure what's going on there yet.

            Not sure if it's just my phone, but playback on Chrome for Android kind of sucks.

            Dragging the playback cursor, mousing over a disabled <strong>Paste</strong>, then dropping, will
            not register the drop and you have to click again to stop dragging the cursor.  I'm too lazy to fix
            it right now.

            If you stop playback close enough to the end of a song and then start it again it will skip over a
            song in the playlist.

            You can't cancel a rendering in progress in Firefox.

            There's currently a lot of ways to mess up WAV rendering by clicking where you shouldn't while it's running.
